This is another project I'm using to practice CSS and HTML. The goal is to create a copy of a Google search results page, at least in appearance, using HTML and CSS. Desired learning outcomes are to become more proficient with HTML, CSS and Git. By the completion of the project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a more complex webpage than the homepage, based on pre-existing content, using CSS and HTML and will also have again demonstrated my ability to use Git and GitHub for version control.

The original idea for this project again comes from The Odin Project's [curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
